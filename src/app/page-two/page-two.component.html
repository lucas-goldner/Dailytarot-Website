      Tarot cards are unlike popular belief not for fortune telling. In Daily
      Tarot you will receive<br />
      every day a new tarot card, which has a description. By following the
      description you<br />
      could notice different things happening in your surroundings or get
      comfortable with a new<br />
      kind of energy. At the end of the day you can go write what happened on
      that day.<br />
      Over time you will grow a collection of events, which could influence you
      in a special way.
